                            rocking chair. Use pillows behind your back, under your elbow and on
                            your lap to support the baby. Use a footstool to bring your knees up
                            or use pillows under your knees if you are sitting up in bed. You
                            should be relaxed with none of your muscles straining. Your baby
                            should be lying on his side with his whole body facing you and his
                            knees pulled in close to your body. There are a number of

                            the beginning it's almost guaranteed to be harder than you expected.
                            From sore nipples to tough latch-ons, nursing can seem overwhelming.

                            place your baby on their back to sleep, even for naps. Place your
                            baby on a firm mattress. Remove soft, fluffy and loose bedding,
                            including blankets, crib bumpers, and stuffed toys from your baby's
                            sleep area. Do not use a sleep positioner to hold your baby on their
                            back or side. Use a sleep sack rather than blankets while your baby
                            is sleeping. Your baby's room should be at a temperature that is
                            comfortable for an adult. Too many layers of clothing or blankets can
                            overheat your baby.

                            as you can when you are in the hospital after giving birth. Ask for a
                            nurse or lactation consultant. <a

                            before I left the hospital." Ask if there's a nursing class or a
                            lactation consultant on staff. Push the nurse-call button each time
                            you're ready to feed the baby, and ask a nurse to spot you and offer
                            advice.

                            everything to feed the baby the moment she cries for you. But Here a
                            mom suggests taking care of yourself first. "Get a glass of water and
                            a book or magazine to read." And, because breastfeeding can take a
                            while, she says, "pee first!"

                            feeding, make sure you are comfortableâ€”empty your bladder, get some
                            water for sipping, and take your time getting into position.

                            breasts are sore after nursing, try a cold pack. Amy Hooker, a San

                            started each of our kids on one bottle a day at 3 weeks," says Jill
                            Sizemore, a mom in Pendleton, Indiana.

                            night but got to sleep in. Richard did all the morning care, then got
                            to nap later."
